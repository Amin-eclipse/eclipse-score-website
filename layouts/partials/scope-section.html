      <h4>ADAS</h4>
      <p>Providing a SW-platform for components requiring high standards on safety and security is a major purpose of S-CORE.</p>

      <h4>Body & Driving</h4>
      <p>With the same explanation as ADAS, Body & Driving domain is in focus of S-CORE.</p>

      <h4>IVI</h4>
      <p>IVI (In-Vehicle-Infotainment) usually only has QM requirements on safety. S-CORE can be used for IVI, but it is not in focus.</p>
